Playing the game:
	HeartBeat
		on SLOW (velocity about 4, negligible acceleration)

		on MEDIUM (velocity about 14, negligible acceleration)
			heart beat rate was between 81 and 84bpm.
		on FAST (velocity about 34, negligible acceleration)

NOTES:

!! the accurary of the first Heart Rate Monitor (Contec CMS50C) is at +-2% or +-2bpm (the biggest one).
